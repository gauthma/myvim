" DOCUMENTATION
"
" Rationale: Consider the		following code snippet (the 11 is at start of line):
" 11. fo sdf sdf sdf sdf sdf sdf sdf sdf sdf sdf sdf sdf sdf sdf sdf
"     sdf sdf sdf sdf sdf
"     22. foof sdf sdf sdf sadf asdf saf sdf sdf sf sdf sadf sdf sdf
"         sdf sdf sdf sdf sdf sdf sdf asdf 
"
" To indent a bullet list, we first discover the line where the current bullet
" starts (ie where the number is). Then use matchend() to align subsequent
" lines in that bullet. However, matchend() does NOT handle tabs (it counts
" them as one char, which screws alignment), so we must calculate the needed
" amount of space for each tab (1), and then replace tabs for spaces before
" calculating the amount of indent space to return (2).
"
" The function BeginOfCurrentListItem() returns the line where the current
" bullet begins. It discovers this by scanning lines upwards, until it finds
" one that matches the pattern. Note that it is NOT enough to just match the
" pattern though, because that will (erroneously) treat text lines that begin
" with /pattern/ also as bullet items. So a line that matches the /pattern/ is
" a bullet if it is the 1st line in file, or if it has some indentation space
" (see example snippet), or otherwise if the line above it is blank (3).
"
" To indent other lines we return the indentation of the previous line (4).
