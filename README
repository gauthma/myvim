My vim config settings. 

INSTALL:
$ git clone git://github.com/gauthma/myvim.git ~/.vim
$ ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc

And presto, it's (almost*) ready to use. Feedback on improvements is always welcome. Enjoy!

* For the final configuration step, checkout the first comment lines in vimrc!

NOTES:
 - when using LaTeX, pressing Esc *once* will keep the insert mode indication, but it will allow you to execute some normal mode commands, in particular saving the file (:w). I'm still working through the details
