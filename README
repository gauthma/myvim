My vim config settings. 

INSTALL:
$ git clone git://github.com/gauthma/myvim.git ~/.vim
$ ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
$ git clone http://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/vundle.git

Next, enter vim, and in normal mode, do :BundleInstall
This will clone all the required plugins from their repos (github, et al.)

Further, from time to time, when you (or I) add new plugins, :BundleInstall
should be ran again. To check for new versions of existing plugins, and
update should they exist, run :BundleInstall!

And presto, it's ready to use. Feedback on improvements is always welcome. Enjoy!

NOTES:
 - The config I use can be found here: https://github.com/gauthma/myvim
 - when using LaTeX, pressing Esc *once* will keep the insert mode indication, but it will allow you to execute some normal mode commands, in particular saving the file (:w). I'm still working through the details
